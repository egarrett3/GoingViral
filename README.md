## Background and Overview 
 * GoingViral will deliver beautiful graphic visualizations of Coronaivrus data 
 from the CDC concerning each state within the U.S. It is imporantant that this data be easily available and engaging. I hope to compare other pandemics to COVID-19. 

## Functionality and MVPs 
 The first version will simply implement certain graphs/charts with interesting graphical flow and interchanges between data sets.
 * MVP1: create a splash page with a clickable picture of COVID-19 virus which brings you to the next page with the graphs.
 * MVP2: implement a carousel sidebar with a list of all U.S. states to click on.
 * MVP3: see a graph showing population, time, number tested, number positive, and number deceased.
 * MVP4: Make the bars pop up/appear in a flowing manner and flow gracefully into other data sets.
 * BONUS: integrate other viruses which will require different API
